         <h3>My Top 3 Starbucks Drinks</h3>

         <p>Starbucks is one of my favorite coffee places, and I started to enjoy it more after I came to MSU during my freshman year. 
            Due to the 1855 Place being pretty close to Wilson Hall, my friends and I used to go there almost every other week. 
            It was nice to have Starbucks considered as a “combo” because we just needed to scan our ID and we could choose a drink 
            and something to eat. I was not much of a big coffee drinker, but since Starbucks is so easily accessible, I began to like 
            it more. I started by drinking the Caffè Latte at the Starbucks in the STEM building after class. It was the perfect amount
            of coffee to milk ratio. I would consider this drink to be third in my top three Starbucks drinks (although the list changes 
            quite often). The second drink I prefer is the Matcha Crème Frappuccino. I like this drink a lot because it isn’t too sweet. 
            My favorite drink from Starbucks is the Iced Brown Sugar Shaken Espresso with sweet cream cold foam and 2 pumps of dark caramel 
            in the foam (with light ice). I know that was a pretty long order, but this drink is amazing. Personally, I think the brown 
            sugar syrup and cinnamon enhances the flavor of the coffee. The sweet cream cold foam on top is a great addition to make this 
            drink a little sweeter to balance the slight bitterness from the coffee.</p>

         <h3>My Thoughts on Social Media</h3>

         <p><img src="socialmedia.jpg" width="430" height="260" alt="How social media affects us psychologically"></p>

         <p>Social media has become a big part of many peoples lives. While I think it is a great way to stay connected, express yourself,
            and learn new things, I believe there are some aspects of social media that are doing more harm than good. TikTok has become 
            one of the most used social media apps that people engage in, especially young kids. It is very easy to lose track of time by 
            seamlessly scrolling through social media. This generation has become “glued” to their phones and it can be detrimental to 
            developing brains of the younger crowd. I think it is good to have a certain time limit for usage. I also do not think humans 
            were meant to see so many faces in their lifetime. It comes to a point where we subconsciously start to compare ourselves to the 
            people we see on social media and sometimes it affects one’s self-esteem. In addition, I think the pre-teen stage which is 
            considered to be one of the “awkward” stages in life isn’t as awkward for pre-teens nowadays because they know what the “older kids”
            are doing at their fingertips. It is interesting to see how that stage is almost skipped in this generation.</p>
