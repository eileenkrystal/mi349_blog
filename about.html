<p>Hi, my name is Eileen! I’m from Troy, Michigan and I am a sophomore at Michigan State University studying computer science. 
   Through the connections I’ve made at MSU, I learned about UX/UI design and I’ve started to become more passionate about 
   learning how to design interfaces that are usable, clear, and aesthetically pleasing. </p>

   <p><img src="me.jpg" alt="A picture of myself for the about me section"></p>

<p>Besides my interest in UI design, my other interests include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>photography</li>
    <li>cooking</li>
    <li>playing the violin</li>
</ul>

<p>Photography is something that I really enjoy doing in my spare time. My interest in scenic photography started when I was
   around twelve years old. I started to cook more during the pandemic. Some of my favorite dishes that I’ve made include chicken 
   noodle soup, fried rice, and fettuccine alfredo. In addition, I’ve been playing the violin since I was seven years old. My 
   elementary school had the chance to teach students how to play the violin in first grade and I've loved it ever since.</p>
